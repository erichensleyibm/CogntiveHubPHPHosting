					Basic mutual fund information
				</h1>
		<p>   'A mutual fund is a managed portfolio  of stocks 
and/or bonds. It pools money from investors to 
buy these  securities.  Mutual funds are often 
intended to beat a benchmark  such as the S&P 
500. Because  they are actively managed, they 
tend to have higher fees.'
